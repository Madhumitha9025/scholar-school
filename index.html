        <h3> Vision</h2>
     
        <p>
            The vision at Scholar School is to prepare and motivate our students for a rapidly changing world by inculcating in them critical thinking skills, a global perspective, and a respect for core values of honesty, loyalty, perseverance, and compassion. Students will have success for today and be prepared for tomorrow.
        </p>
   
        <h3>Mission</h2>
 
        <p>
            Scholar Schoolâ€™s mission is to enable children to be prepared for life through experiential learning that addresses the needs of the whole child. We create a safe and secure school environment that promotes social and academic growth and develops an enthusiasm for learning, a positive self-image, cross-cultural understanding, and the ability to integrate into new cultures and environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals</h2>
    
        <p>
            Scholar School strives to give each child a lifelong appreciation of learning. Almost all the students in our school are from very poor and broken families dwelling in rural areas. Our sole aim is to provide them with a rich educational environment that can enable every student with a broad foundation of knowledge and practical experience. The curriculum integrates with our Tamil Nadu Government Standards and is delivered through multi-graded classroom programs. Well-rounded instruction is complemented by a variety of programs, including yoga, physical education, as well as visual, performing, and culinary arts. Students develop a sense of community while maintaining individuality and creative self-expression. Our diverse community fosters cooperative skills, mutual respect, and pride in academic progress.

        <h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
        <h3>THE PRE PRIMARY PROGRAM</h3>
        <p>The Pre Primary Program for Nursery to Class II offers a stimulating, caring and
            relaxed atmosphere of hands on experiential learning to develop skills that set them
            on the road to be great learners. Work and play are inter-woven to help children
            explore their curiosity and make every moment a learning experience.</p>
        <h3>THE PRIMARY PROGRAM</h3>
        <p>The Primary Program continues to develop skills essential for learning such as the
            development of thinking, communication, research and self-management. The
            teachers foster an atmosphere that is personalized and child centered. The project
            based learning in the primary school inculcates a spirit of enquiry that sets children
            on the path of self learning</p>
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>A young mind is always amazed by oral language and stories with expression. In
            our school we create a rich educational environment that enables children always
            interested and joyful in repeating vocabulary words. The students work with many
            different pictures, cards and books to establish their vocabulary. They are also
            encouraged do express their feelings freely.
            Scholar school provides the Montessori classroom; in which, a child learns the
            phonetic sounds of the letters before he learns the alphabetical names in a
            sequence. The phonetic sounds are given first because these are the sounds he
            hears in words that he needs to be able to read. The child first becomes aware of
            these phonetic sounds when the teacher introduces the consonants with sandpaper
            letters.
            The individual presentation of language materials in a Montessori classroom
            allows the teacher to take the advantage of each child's greatest periods of interest.
            Reading instructions begins on the day when the child wants to know what a word
            says or when he shows an interest in using the movable letters nearly always
            
            precedes reading in a Montessori environment. By doping many reading exercise
            which offer variety rather than monotonous repetition, gradually the child learns
            irregular words, and words with two and three syllables. Also available in the
            Montessori classroom are many attractive books which use a large number of
            phonetic words. Proceeding at their own pace, the child is encouraged to read
            about things which interest him. His skills in phonics give him the means of
            attacking almost any news word, so that he is not limited to specific number of
            words which he has been trained to recognize by sight.
            The child's interest in reading is never stifled by monotony. Rather, it is cultivated
            as his most important hey to future learning. He is encouraged to explore books for
            answers to his own questions.</p>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>It is our strong belief that if a child has access to mathematical equipment in his
            early years, he can easily and joyfully assimilate many facts and skills of
            arithmetic. On the other hand, these same facts and skills may require long hours
            of drill if they are introduced to them later in the abstract from. After observing
            that a child who becomes interested in counting likes to touch or move the items as
            he enumerates them, we follow Dr. Montessori who designed concrete materials to
            represent all types of quantities. By combining this equipment, separating it,
            sharing it, counting it, and comparing it, the child can demonstrate to himself the
            basic operation of mathematics. The child in our class does not sit down to
            memorize addition and subtraction facts. Rather, he learns these facts by actually
            performing the operations with concrete materials.
            When the child wants to do arithmetic, he is given a sheet of paper containing
            simple problems. He works the problems with appropriate materials and records
            his results. Similar operations can be performed with a variety of materials. These
            varieties maintain the child interest while giving him many opportunities for
            necessary repetition. As he commits the additional facts and the multiplications
            tables to memory, he gains a real understanding of what each operation means.
            They are many materials that can be used for numeration, addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and division.</p>
        <h3>Science and nature</h3>
        <p>Our school aims at inducing natural curiosity through the scientific studies such as
            discovery projects and experiments, which enable the child, draw his own
            conclusions. The plant and animal kingdoms re studied in an orderly fashion to
            foster a love and appreciation for all living things.</p>
        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>Among the most popular activities in the classroom, our school provides the large
            wooden maps. At first the child uses the maps simply as puzzles. Gradually he
            learns the names of many of the countries as well as information about culture,
            climate, and landmarks. The maps illustrate many geographical facts concretely.
            The child also learns about common land and water formations such as islands
            peninsulas, isthmus, gulfs and straits.</p>
        <h3>Cultural Exercises</h3>
        <p>A Children are encouraged and given enough chances to go through periods of
            keen sensitivity to language, mathematics, geography, music, Yoga etc. Their
            interest in learning is natural and intense. Since materials and guidance are always
            at hand, the child can work at a particular interest and get satisfied in his/her need
            to know more and more. By the end of each year, children are stimulated by the
            activities of the other children and the guidance of the teacher, his/her interests
            have usually widened into many areas and perspectives.</p>
